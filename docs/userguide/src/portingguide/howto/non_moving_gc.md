# Collecting Garbage: Getting Started with Integrating MMTk

Your choice of the next GC plan to implement depends on your situation. If
youâ€™re developing a new VM from scratch, or if you are intimately familiar with
the internals of your target VM, then implementing a SemiSpace collector is
probably the best course of action. Although the GC itself is rather
simplistic, it stresses many of the key components of the MMTk <-> VM binding
that will be required for later (and more powerful) GCs. In particular, since
it always moves objects, it is an excellent stress test. Otherwise, a
non-moving GC like MarkSweep or a non-moving Immix implementation would work
better.

We note that most of the API you need to implement between the moving and
non-moving GC will be the same (with moving GCs having to implement a few extra
APIs), so regardless of what you choose, the steps in this guide will be
applicable. For this guide, we start by integrating a non-moving Immix
implementation and then add support for moving objects. In order to use a
non-moving Immix implementation, enable the ["immix_non_moving" feature of
mmtk-core](TODO(kunals)). We also recommend turning the
["immix_zero_on_release" feature](TODO(kunals)) on for debugging.

Like with the [NoGC guide](./nogc.md), "Runtime-side changes" mean any changes
you have to make to your runtime or the part of the MMTk binding interfacing
with the runtime; and "MMTk-side changes" mean any changes you have to make to
the part of the MMTk binding interfacing with MMTk core.

## Initializing and Enabling Collection

In the NoGC port, we actually skipped over initializing and enabling garbage
collection as we were only concerned with allocating objects. This is required
as MMTk spawns GC threads when you enable collection. This is a separate step as
it is often the case that the threading subsystem of a runtime has not been
fully set up when the `MMTK` instance is created.

<!-- You may have noticed the `mmtk_initialize_collection` function defined above in the `mmtk.h` file. This function is called after the runtime has completely set up including (but not limited to) its thread system. This function will spawn GC threads and allow MMTk to collect objects. For the time-being we can ignore calling this function as NoGC does not collect objects so does not require calling `mmtk_initialize_collection`. -->


### Runtime-side changes

Add the following function to the `mmtk.h` file:

```C
[...]

/**
 * Initialize collection for MMTk
 *
 * @param tls reference to the calling VMThread
 */
void mmtk_initialize_collection(VMThread tls);

[...]
```

You should call this function after the threading subsystem of your runtime has
initialized and allows new threads to be spawned. You can pass a reference to
the calling runtime thread, but passing in a `nullptr` will also suffice.

### MMTk-side changes

The Rust side of the binding should simply defer the actual implementation to
[`mmtk::memory_manager::initialize_collection`](https://docs.mmtk.io/api/mmtk/memory_manager/fn.initialize_collection.html).
See the [OpenJDK binding](https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-openjdk/blob/0ed99cd8cf51bb5ff8184ef64f8236d85e960e87/mmtk/src/api.rs#L245-L248) for an example.

## "Upcalls" Design Pattern

The nature of the bi-directional API means that there are things that MMTk
requires or expects from the runtime and vice-versa. While it is easy for a
language runtime to use the API exposed by MMTk (the set of public functions in
`mmtk.h`), it is not always easy for the Rust source of MMTk to directly call
into the runtime given they may be implemented in a different language.

In order to facilitate this, we utilize a design pattern wherein we define a
`struct` of function pointers that is passed on to MMTk during initialization.
These function pointers essentially are the API exposed by the VM to MMTk. The
`struct` is often termed "Upcalls" given MMTk is calling up to the runtime.

Let's take the example of a simple upcall and implement that: getting the size
of a given object.

## Spawning GC Threads

You will notice that now your runtime immediately panics since MMTk is unable to spawn its GC threads. We need to implement the [`VMCollection::spawn_gc_thread`](https://docs.mmtk.io/api/mmtk/vm/trait.Collection.html#tymethod.spawn_gc_thread) API.

Currently there are two kinds of GC threads: (i) Coordinator thread and (ii) GC
Worker thread. There is always only one Coordinator thread and its job is to
coordinate GC activities between the different worker threads. The Coordinator
thread does not perform any GC activities itself. The GC Worker threads actually
perform GC activities such as roots scanning, marking objects, etc. The number
of GC Worker threads can be controlled with the [`threads` MMTk
option](https://docs.mmtk.io/api/mmtk/util/options/struct.Options.html#structfield.threads)
(See the [NoGC guide](./nogc.md#setting-options-for-mmtk) for more information
about setting MMTk options).

> **Note:** Since the Coordinator thread always exists, if we set the number of
> GC threads to 1, the actual number of threads is spawned is still 2.

### Runtime-side changes

Spawning GC threads is highly dependant on your runtime's threading subsystem.

### MMTk-side changes

If your runtime is single-threaded or perhaps it is too difficult to support
creating MMTk GC threads, then you could spawn GC threads in the MMTk-side of
the binding instead.

## Suspending (and Resuming) Mutator Threads

The first thing MMTk core does when it finds itself out of memory is block the
mutator thread that failed the allocation. This check only happens in the
slow-path (when the runtime goes and gets a new thread-local buffer from MMTk).
